# DeBridge DBR Airdrop Checker

![debridge-airdrop-checker](screenshot.png)

A Node.js tool to verify wallet address eligibility for DeBridge DRB airdrops. This script reads from an eligibility list TSV file and checks against wallet addresses from a text file, logging eligible addresses with their corresponding token allocations in green and saving them to `eligible_addresses.txt`.

## Features

- **Super Fast and Efficient**: Provides results in milliseconds due to offline checking.
- Reads eligibility data from a TSV file
- Loads wallet addresses from a text file
- Checks lowercase versions of wallet addresses
- Logs eligible addresses and token allocations in green for easy identification
- Saves eligible addresses to `eligible_addresses.txt`

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dmytrmk/DeBridge-DBR-Airdrop-Checker.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd DeBridge-DBR-Airdrop-Checker
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your `wallet_addresses.txt` file with one wallet address per line:
    ```txt
    0x1234...
    0xabcd...
    ```

2. Run the airdrop checker:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
In first run it will download the eligibility list file approximately ~80mb in size and save as TokenAllocationS1_4.tsv

The script will output eligible addresses and their token allocations in green and save them to `eligible_addresses.txt`.

## Example Output

If an address is eligible, the script will log:
`0x1234â€¦ - Token Allocation: 1000.5`
